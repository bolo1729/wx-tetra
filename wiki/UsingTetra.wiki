#summary How to use Tetra

= Requirements =

In order to use Tetra, you should have the following software installed:
  * Perl
  * WxWidgets
  * ImageMagick
  * Tesseract OCR (optional)
Tetra was tested on GNU/Linux.  It _might_ require a few minor changes
in order to run on another UNIX-like platform, and _will_ require the
changes on other platforms (esp. MS Windows).

= Usage =

Run `tetra.pl`, and you should see the main application window.

Click "Manage PDFs" to add/remove PDF files to the program.
File addition might take a while: the PDFs are converted to images,
page-by-page, and initial boxfiles are generated (provided you have
Tesseract OCR installed).

In the main window, choose the page you wish to edit.  Next, choose
a box from the list on the left, or use the "+" and "-" buttons below
the list to add/remove boxes.  The current box is shown in red, you
can move/resize it using left mouse button.  Input field below
the list of boxes always has keyboard focus, so simply type the
characters you see in the box.  <ENTER> accepts the modifications
and moves to the next box.
That way, you may traverse the list of boxes by hitting <ENTER>,
and modifying a box when necessary.

Save button writes changes in _all the modified pages_, not just the
current one.
