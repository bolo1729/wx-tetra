= Introduction =

Tetra is a simple GUI application for editing Tesseract OCR box files.  It reads PDF files, converts them to TIF format, generates initial box files (provided that Tesseract OCR is installed), and allows basic box manipulation.

GNU/Linux is the best platform for this application, but it runs under MS Windows too.
See [Requirements] for details.

= Usage =

Run `tetra.pl` (UNIX) or `tetra.bat` (MS Windows), and you should see the main application window.

Click "Manage PDFs" to add/remove PDF files to the program.  File addition might take a while: the PDFs are converted to images, page-by-page, and initial boxfiles are generated (provided you have Tesseract OCR installed).

In the main window, choose the page you wish to edit.  Next, choose a box from the list on the left, or use the "+" and "-" buttons below the list to add/remove boxes.  The current box is shown in red, you can move/resize it using left mouse button.  Input field below the list of boxes always has keyboard focus, so simply type the characters you see in the box.  <ENTER> accepts the modifications and moves to the next box. That way, you may traverse the list of boxes by hitting <ENTER>, and modifying a box when necessary.

Save button writes changes in _all the modified pages_, not just the current one.
